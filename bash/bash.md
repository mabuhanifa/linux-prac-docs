**1. Introduction to Bash**

- **What is Bash?**

  - Bash is a command-line interface (CLI) and scripting language for Unix-like operating systems, including Linux.
  - It serves as an intermediary between the user and the operating system, accepting commands and executing them.

- **History of Bash**
  - Bash is based on the Bourne Shell (sh), developed by Stephen Bourne in the 1970s.
  - It was created by Brian Fox in 1989 as a free replacement for the Bourne Shell.
  - GNU Bash, the most widely used version, was released as part of the GNU Project.
- **Why use Bash?**
  - Bash is a powerful and versatile tool for managing files, automating tasks, and interacting with the system.
  - It provides access to a wide range of system utilities and commands.
  - Bash scripting allows for automation and the creation of complex workflows.

**2. Getting Started**

- **Launching the Bash Shell**

  - Open a terminal emulator (e.g., GNOME Terminal, Konsole).
  - The default shell is usually Bash, but you can check with `echo $SHELL`.

- **The Bash Prompt**

  - The prompt displays information about the current shell environment.
  - By default, it shows the username, hostname, current directory, and a `>` symbol.

- **Basic Command Structure**

  - Commands are entered as text and followed by pressing Enter.
  - Syntax: `command [options] [arguments]`.

- **Running Commands**
  - To run a command, simply type it and press Enter.
  - Example: `ls -l` lists files in the current directory.

**3. File and Directory Operations**

- **Navigating the File System**

  - `cd` - Change directory.
  - `pwd` - Print the current working directory.
  - `ls` - List files and directories.
  - `mkdir` - Create a directory.
  - `rmdir` - Remove an empty directory.

- **Working with Files**
  - `touch` - Create an empty file.
  - `cat` - Concatenate and display file contents.
  - `cp` - Copy files and directories.
  - `mv` - Move or rename files and directories.
  - `rm` - Remove files and directories.

**4. Working with Text**

  - `fg` - Bring a job to the foreground.
  - `jobs` - List background jobs.

**7. Shell Scripting**

- **What is a Shell Script?**

  - A shell script is a text file containing a sequence of Bash commands.
  - It can be executed like a program.

- **Creating and Executing Shell Scripts**

  - Create a text file with a `.sh` extension.
  - Add a shebang line (`#!/bin/bash`) at the beginning.
  - Make the script executable with `chmod +x script.sh`.
  - Run the script with `./script.sh`.

- **Variables and Data Types**

  - Variables store data (e.g., strings, numbers).
  - Variable assignment: `variable=value`.
  - Data types: strings, numbers, arrays.

- **Conditional Statements**

  - `if`, `elif`, `else` - Conditionally execute commands.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    if [ condition ]; then
      # Commands if condition is true
    elif [ another_condition ]; then
      # Commands if another_condition is true
    else
      # Commands if no condition is true
    fi
    ```

- **Looping Constructs**

  - `for` - Iterate over a list of items.
  - `while` - Execute commands while a condition is true.
  - `until` - Execute commands until a condition is true.

- **Functions**
  - Define and call functions.
  - Functions encapsulate a sequence of commands.
  - Example:
    ```bash
    function my_function() {
      # Function commands
    }
    my_function  # Call the function
    ```

**8. Advanced Bash Features**

- **Command Substitution**

  - `$(command)` - Capture the output of a command and use it as a value.
  - Example: `result=$(ls -l)`

- **Brace Expansion**

  - `{a,b,c}` - Generate a list of values.
  - Example: `echo {1..5}` prints `1 2 3 4 5`.

- **File Globbing**

  - `*`, `?`, `[ ]` - Match filenames using wildcards.
  - Example: `ls *.txt` lists all `.txt` files.

- **Aliases and Functions**

  - Create shortcuts for commands with `alias`.
  - Define custom functions for complex tasks.

- **History and Command Recall**
  - `history` - View command history.
  - `!!` - Repeat the last command.
  - `!n` - Repeat command number `n`.

**9. Scripting Best Practices**

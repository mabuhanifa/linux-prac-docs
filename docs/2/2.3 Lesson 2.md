Lesson:

2 of 2
Introduction

The Unix operating system was originally designed for mainframe computers in the mid-1960s. These computers were shared among many users, who accessed the system’s resources through terminals. These fundamental ideas carry through to Linux systems today. We still talk about using “terminals” to enter commands in the shell, and every Linux system is organized in such a way that it is easy to create many users on a single system.
Home Directories

This is an example of a normal file system in Linux:

$ tree -L 1 /
/
├── bin
├── boot
├── cdrom
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── lib
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── run
├── sbin
├── srv
├── sys
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var

Most of these directories are consistent across all Linux systems. From servers to supercomputers to tiny embedded systems, a seasoned Linux user can be confident that they can find the ls command inside /bin, can change the system configuration by modifying files in /etc, and read system logs in /var. The standard location of these files and directories is defined by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which will be discussed in a later lesson. You will learn more about the contents of these directories as you continue learning about Linux, but for the time being, know that:

    changes that you make in the root filesystem will affect all users, and

    changing files in the root filesystem will require administrator permissions.

This means that normal users will be prohibited from modifying these files, and may also be prohibited from even reading these files. We will cover the topic of permissions in a later section.

Now, we will focus on the directory /home, which should be somewhat familiar at this point:

$ tree -L 1 /home
/home
├── user
├── michael
└── lara

Our example system has three normal users, and each of our users has their own dedicated location, where they can create and modify files and directories without affecting their neighbor. For example, in the previous lesson we were working with the following file structure:

$ tree /home/user
user
└── Documents
├── Mission-Statement
└── Reports
└── report2018.txt

In actuality, the real filesystem may look like this:

$ tree /home
/home
├── user
│ └── Documents
│ ├── Mission-Statement
│ └── Reports
│ └── report2018.txt
├── michael
│ ├── Documents
│ │ └── presentation-for-clients.odp
│ └── Music

…​and so on for lara.

In Linux, /home is similar to an apartment building. Many users may have their space here, separated into dedicated apartments. The utilities and maintenance of the building itself are the responsibility of the superintendent root user.
The Special Relative Path for Home

When you start a new terminal session in Linux, you see a command prompt similar to this:

user@hostname ~ $

The tilde (~) here represents our home directory. If you run the ls command, you will see some familiar output:

$ cd ~
$ ls
Documents

Compare that with the file system above to check your understanding.

Consider now what we know about Linux: it is similar to an apartment building, with many users residing in /home. So user 's home will be different from user michael 's home. To demonstrate this, we will use the su command to switch user.

user@hostname ~ $ pwd
/home/user
user@hostname ~ $ su - michael
Password:
michael@hostname ~ $ pwd
/home/michael

The meaning of ~ changes depending of who the user is. For michael, the absolute path of ~ is /home/michael. For lara, the absolute path of ~ is /home/lara, and so on.
Relative-to-Home File Paths

Using ~ for commands is very convenient, provided that you don’t switch users. We will consider the following example for user, who has begun a new session:

$ ls
Documents
$ cd Documents
$ ls
Mission-Statement
Reports
$ cd Reports
$ ls
report2018.txt
$ cd ~
$ ls
Documents

Note that users will always begin a new session in their home directory. In this example, user has traveled into their Documents/Reports subdirectory, and with the cd ~ command they have returned to where they started. You can perform the same action by using the cd command with no arguments:

$ cd Documents/Reports
$ pwd
/home/user/Documents/Reports
$ cd
$ pwd
/home/user

One last thing to note: we can specify the home directories of other users by specifying the username after the tilde. For example:

$ ls ~michael
Documents
Music

Note that this will only work if michael has given us permission to view the contents of his home directory.

Let’s consider a situation where michael would like to view the file report2018.txt in user 's home directory. Assuming that michael has the permission to do so, he can use the less command.

$ less ~user/Documents/Reports/report2018.txt

Any file path that contains the ~ character is called a relative-to-home path.
Hidden Files and Directories

In the previous lesson, we introduced the option -a for the ls command. We used ls -a to introduce the two special relative paths: . and ... The -a option will list all files and directories, including hidden files and directories.

$ ls -a ~
.
..
.bash_history
.bash_logout
.bash-profile
.bashrc
Documents

Hidden files and directories will always begin with a period (.). By default, a user’s home directory will include many hidden files. These are often used to set user-specific configuration settings, and should only be modified by an experienced user.
The Long List Option

The ls command has many options to change its behavior. Let’s look at one of the most common options:

$ ls -l
-rw-r--r-- 1 user staff 3606 Jan 13 2017 report2018.txt

-l creates a long list. Files and directories will each occupy one line, but additional information about each file and directory will be displayed.

-rw-r—​r--

    Type of file and permissions of the file. Note that a regular file will begin with dash, and a directory will start with d.

1

    Number of links to the file.

user staff

    Specifies ownership of the file. user is the owner of the file, and the file is also associated with the staff group.

3606

    Size of the file in bytes.

Jan 13 2017

    Time stamp of the last modification to the file.

report2018.txt

    Name of the file.

Subjects such as ownership, permissions and links will be covered in future sections. As you can see, the long list version of the ls is oftentimes preferable to the default.
Additional ls Options

Below are some of the ways that we most commonly use the ls command. As you can see, the user can combine many options together to get the desired output.

ls -lh

    Combining long list with human readable file sizes will give us useful suffixes such as M for megabytes or K for kilobytes.

ls -d \*/

    The -d option will list directories but not their contents. Combining this with */ will show only subdirectories and no files.

ls -lt

    Combines long list with the option to sort by modification time. The files with the most recent changes will be at the top, and files with the oldest changes will be at the bottom. But this order can be reversed with:

ls -lrt

    Combines long list with sort by (modification) time, combined with -r which reverses the sort. Now files with the most recent changes are at the bottom of the list. In addition to sorting by modification time, files can also be sorted by access time or by status time.

ls -lX

    Combines long list with the option to sort by file eXtension. This will, for example, group all files ending with .txt together, all files ending with .jpg together, and so on.

ls -S

    The -S sorts by file size, much in the same way as -t and -X sort by time and extension respectively. The largest files will come first, and smallest last. Note that the contents of subdirectories are not included in the sort.

ls -R

    The -R option will modify the ls command to display a recursive list. What does this mean?

Recursion in Bash

Recursion refers to a situation when “something is defined in terms of itself”. Recursion is a very important concept in computer science, but here its meaning is far simpler. Let’s consider our example from before:

$ ls ~
Documents

We know from before that user has a home directory, and in this directory there is one subdirectory. ls has up until now only shown us the files and subdirectories of a location, but cannot tell us the contents of these subdirectories. In these lessons, we have been using the tree command when we wanted to display the contents of many directories. Unfortunately, tree is not one of the core utilities of Linux and thus is not always available. Compare the output of tree with the output of ls -R in the following examples:

$ tree /home/user
user
└── Documents
├── Mission-Statement
└── Reports
└── report2018.txt

$ ls -R ~
/home/user/:
Documents

/home/user/Documents:
Mission-Statement
Reports

/home/user/Documents/Reports:
report2018.txt

As you can see, with the recursive option, we get a far longer list of files. In fact, it is as if we ran the ls command in user 's home directory, and encountered one subdirectory. Then, we entered into that subdirectory and ran the ls command again. We encountered the file Mission-Statement and another subdirectory called Reports. And again, we entered into the subdirectory, and ran the ls command again. Essentially, running ls -R is like telling Bash: “Run ls here, and repeat the command in every subdirectory that you find.”

Recursion is particularly important in file modification commands such as copying or removing directories. For example, if you wanted to copy the Documents subdirectory, you would need to specify a recursive copy in order to extend this command to all subdirectories.

        When you run the command ls -lrS, what file will be at the beginning?

        Please describe what you expect to see as the output for ls -ad */.

Explorational Exercises

    Run the ls -lh command in a directory that contains subdirectories. Note the listed size of these directories. Do these file sizes seem correct to you? Do they accurately represent the contents of all files inside that directory?

    Here is a new command to try: du -h. Run this command and describe the output that it gives you.

    On many Linux systems, you can type in ll and get the same output as you would if you typed ls -l. Please note however that ll is not a command. For example, man ll will give you the message that no manual entry exists for it. This is an example of an alias. Why might aliases be useful to a user?

Summary

In this lab, you learned:

    that each Linux user will have a home directory,

    the current user’s home directory can be reached by using ~,

    any file path that uses ~ is called a relative-to-home path.

You also learned about some of the most common ways of modifying the `ls command.

-a (all)

    prints all files/directories, including hidden

-d (directories)

    list directories, not their contents

-h (human readable)

    prints file sizes in human readable format

-l (long list)

    provides extra details, one file/directory per line

-r (reverse)

    reverses the order of a sort

-R (recursive)

    lists every file, including files in each subdirectory

-S (size)

    sorts by file size

-t (time)

    sorts by modification time

-X (eXtension)

    sorts by file extension

        When you run the command ls -lrS, what file will be at the beginning?

        The three folders are all 4.0K, which is the smallest file size. ls will then sort the directories alphabetically by default. The correct answer is the file scary.jpg.

        Please describe what you expect to see as the output for ls -ad */.

        This command will show all subdirectories, including hidden subdirectories.

Answers to Explorational Exercises

    Run the ls -lh command in a directory that contains subdirectories. Note the listed size of these directories. Do these file sizes seem correct to you? Do they accurately represent the contents of all files inside that directory?

    No, they do not. Each directory has a listed file size of 4096 bytes. This is because directories here are an abstraction: they don’t exist as a tree structure on the disk. When you see a directory listed, you are seeing a link to a list of files. The size of these links is 4096 bytes.

    Here is a new command to try: du -h. Run this command and describe the output that it gives you.

    The du command will generate a list of all files and directories, and indicate the size of each. For example, du -s will display the file size of all files, directories, and subdirectories for a certain location.

    On many Linux systems, you can type in ll and get the same output as you would if you typed ls -l. Please note however that ll is not a command. For example, man ll will give you the message that no manual entry exists for it. What does this suggest to you about a feature of the command line?

    ll is an alias of ls -l. In Bash, we can use aliases to simplify commonly-used commands. ll is often defined for you in Linux, but you can create your own as well.

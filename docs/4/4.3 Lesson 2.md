Introduction

After exploring programs and their configuration files, in this lesson we will learn how commands are executed as processes. Likewise, we will be commenting on the system messaging, the use of the kernel ring buffer and how the arrival of systemd and its journal daemon — journald — changed the ways things had been done so far regarding system logging.
Processes

Every time a user issues a command, a program is run and one or more processes are generated.

Processes exist in a hierarchy. After the kernel is loaded in memory on boot, the first process is initiated which — in turn — starts other processes, which, again, can start other processes. Every process has a unique identifier (PID) and parent process identifier (PPID). These are positive integers that are assigned in sequential order.
Exploring Processes Dynamically: top

You can get a dynamic listing of all running processes with the top command:

$ top

top - 11:10:29 up 2:21, 1 user, load average: 0,11, 0,20, 0,14
Tasks: 73 total, 1 running, 72 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie
%Cpu(s): 0,0 us, 0,3 sy, 0,0 ni, 99,7 id, 0,0 wa, 0,0 hi, 0,0 si, 0,0 st
KiB Mem : 1020332 total, 909492 free, 38796 used, 72044 buff/cache
KiB Swap: 1046524 total, 1046524 free, 0 used. 873264 avail Mem

10 root 0 -20 0 0 0 S 0,0 0,0 0:00.00 lru-add-drain
(...)

As we saw above, top can also give us information about memory and CPU consumption of the overall system as well as for each process.

top allows the user some interaction.

By default, the output is sorted by the percentage of CPU time used by each process in descending order. This behavior can be modified by pressing the following keys from within top:

M

    Sort by memory usage.

N

    Sort by process ID number.

T

    Sort by running time.

P

    Sort by percentage of CPU usage.

To switch between descending/ascending order just press R.
Tip

A fancier and more user-friendly version of top is htop. Another — perhaps more exhaustive — alternative is atop. If not already installed in your system, I encourage you to use your package manager to install them and give them a try.
A Snapshot of Processes: ps

Another very useful command to get information about processes is ps. Whereas top provides dynamic information, that of ps is static.

If invoked without options, the output of ps is quite discrete and relates only to the processes attached to the current shell:

$ ps
PID TTY TIME CMD
2318 pts/0 00:00:00 bash
2443 pts/0 00:00:00 ps

The displayed information has to do with the process identifier (PID), the terminal in which the process is run (TTY), the CPU time taken by the process (TIME) and the command which started the process (CMD).

A useful switch for ps is -f which shows the full-format listing:

$ ps -f
UID PID PPID C STIME TTY TIME CMD
carol 2318 1682 0 08:38 pts/1 00:00:00 bash
carol 2443 2318 0 08:46 pts/1 00:00:00 ps -f

In combination with other switches, -f shows the relationship between parent and child processes:

$ ps -uf
USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND
carol 2318 0.0 0.1 21336 5140 pts/1 Ss 08:38 0:00 bash
carol 2492 0.0 0.0 38304 3332 pts/1 R+ 08:51 0:00 \_ ps -uf
carol 1780 0.0 0.1 21440 5412 pts/0 Ss 08:28 0:00 bash
carol 2291 0.0 0.7 305352 28736 pts/0 Sl+ 08:35 0:00 \_ emacs index.en.adoc -nw
(...)

Likewise, ps can show the percentage of memory used when invoked with the -v switch:

$ ps -v
PID TTY STAT TIME MAJFL TRS DRS RSS %MEM COMMAND
1163 tty2 Ssl+ 0:00 1 67 201224 5576 0.1 /usr/lib/gdm3/gdm-x-session (...)
(...)

Note

Another visually attractive command that shows the hierarchy of processes is pstree. It ships with all major distributions.
Process Information in the /proc Directory

We have already seen the /proc filesystem. /proc includes a numbered subdirectory for every running process in the system (the number is the PID of the process):

carol@debian:~# ls /proc
1 108 13 17 21 27 354 41 665 8 9
10 109 14 173 22 28 355 42 7 804 915
103 11 140 18 23 29 356 428 749 810 918
104 111 148 181 24 3 367 432 75 811
105 112 149 19 244 349 370 433 768 83
106 115 15 195 25 350 371 5 797 838
107 12 16 2 26 353 404 507 798 899
(...)

Thus, all the information about a particular process is included within its directory. Let us list the contents of the first process — that whose PID is 1 (the output has been truncated for readability):

# ls /proc/1/

attr cmdline environ io mem ns
autogroup comm exe limits mountinfo numa_maps
auxv coredump_filter fd loginuid mounts oom_adj
...

You can check — for instance — the process executable:

# cat /proc/1/cmdline; echo

/sbin/init

As you can see, the binary that started the hierarchy of processes was /sbin/init.
Note

Commands can be concatenated with the semicolon (;). The point in using the echo command above is to provide a newline. Try and run simply cat /proc/1/cmdline to see the difference.
The System Load

Each process on a system can potentially consume system resources. The so-called system load tries to aggregate the overall load of the system into a single numeric indicator. You can see the current load with the command uptime:

$ uptime
22:12:54 up 13 days, 20:26, 1 user, load average: 2.91, 1.59, 0.39

The three last digits indicate the system’s load average for the last minute (2.91), the last five minutes (1.59) and the last fifteen minutes (0.39), respectively.

Each of these numbers indicates how many processes were waiting either for CPU resources or for input/output operations to complete. This means that these processes were ready to run if they had received the respective resources.
System Logging and System Messaging

As soon as the kernel and the processes start executing and communicating with each other, a lot of information is produced. Most of it is sent to files — the so-called log files or, simply, logs.

Without logging, searching for an event that happened on a server would give sysadmins many a headache, hence the importance of having a standardized and centralized way of keeping track of any system events. Besides, logs are determinant and telling when it comes to troubleshooting and security as well as reliable data sources for understanding system statistics and making trend predictions.
Logging with the syslog Daemon

Traditionally, system messages have been managed by the standard logging facility — syslog — or any of its derivatives — syslog-ng or rsyslog. The logging daemon collects messages from other services and programs and stores them in log files, typically under /var/log. However, some services take care of their own logs (take — for example — the Apache HTTPD web server). Likewise, the Linux kernel uses an in-memory ring buffer for storing its log messages.
Log Files in /var/log

Because logs are data that varies over time, they are normally found in /var/log.

If you explore /var/log, you will realize that the names of logs are — to a certain degree — quite self-explanatory. Some examples include:

/var/log/auth.log

    It stores information about authentication.

/var/log/kern.log

    It stores kernel information.

/var/log/syslog

    It stores system information.

/var/log/messages

    It stores system and application data.

Note

The exact name and contents of log files may vary across Linux distributions.
Accessing Log Files

When exploring log files, remember to be root (if you do not have reading permissions) and use a pager such as less;

# less /var/log/messages

Jun 4 18:22:48 debian liblogging-stdlog: [origin software="rsyslogd" swVersion="8.24.0" x-pid="285" x-info="http://www.rsyslog.com"] rsyslogd was HUPed

Jun 29 16:57:10 debian kernel: [ 0.000000] Command line: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-4.9.0-8-amd64 root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet

Alternatively, you can use tail with the -f switch to read the most recent messages of the file and dynamically show new lines as they are appended:

# tail -f /var/log/messages

You will find the output into the following format:

    Timestamp

    Hostname from which the message came from

    Name of program/service that generated the message

    The PID of the program that generated the message

    Description of the action that took place

Most log files are written in plain text; however, a few can contain binary data as is the case with /var/log/wtmp — which stores data relevant to successful logins. You can use the file command to determine which is the case:

$ file /var/log/wtmp
/var/log/wtmp: dBase III DBT, version number 0, next free block index 8

These files are normally read using special commands. last is used to interpret the data in /var/log/wtmp:

$ last
carol tty2 :0 Thu May 30 10:53 still logged in
reboot system boot 4.9.0-9-amd64 Thu May 30 10:52 still running
carol tty2 :0 Thu May 30 10:47 - crash (00:05)
reboot system boot 4.9.0-9-amd64 Thu May 30 09:11 still running
carol tty2 :0 Tue May 28 08:28 - 14:11 (05:42)
reboot system boot 4.9.0-9-amd64 Tue May 28 08:27 - 14:11 (05:43)
carol tty2 :0 Mon May 27 19:40 - 19:52 (00:11)

carol tty2 :0 Mon May 27 19:35 - down (00:03)
reboot system boot 4.9.0-9-amd64 Mon May 27 19:34 - 19:38 (00:04)

Note

Similar to /var/log/wtmp, /var/log/btmp stores information about failed login attempts and the special command to read its contents is lastb.
Log Rotation

Log files can grow a lot over a few weeks or months and take up all free disk space. To tackle this, the utility logrotate is used. It implements log rotation or cycling which implies actions such as moving log files to a new name, archiving and/or compressing them, sometimes emailing them to the sysadmin and eventually deleting them as they grow old. The conventions used for naming these rotated log files are diverse (adding a suffix with the date, for example); however, simply adding a suffix with an integer is commonplace:

# ls /var/log/apache2/

access.log error.log error.log.1 error.log.2.gz other_vhosts_access.log

Note how error.log.2.gz has already been compressed with gzip (hence the .gz suffix).
The Kernel Ring Buffer

The kernel ring buffer is a fixed-size data structure that records kernel boot messages as well as any live kernel messages. The function of this buffer — a very important one — is that of logging all the kernel messages produced on boot — when syslog is not yet available. The dmesg command prints the kernel ring buffer (which used to be also stored in /var/log/dmesg). Because of the extension of the ring buffer, this command is normally used in combination with the text filtering utility grep or a pager such as less. For instance, to search for boot messages:

$ dmesg | grep boot
[ 0.000000] Command line: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-4.9.0-9-amd64 root=UUID=5216e1e4-ae0e-441f-b8f5-8061c0034c74 ro quiet
[ 0.000000] smpboot: Allowing 1 CPUs, 0 hotplug CPUs
[ 0.000000] Kernel command line: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-4.9.0-9-amd64 root=UUID=5216e1e4-ae0e-441f-b8f5-8061c0034c74 ro quiet
[ 0.144986] AppArmor: AppArmor disabled by boot time parameter
(...)

Note

As the kernel ring buffer grows with new messages over time, the oldest ones will fade away.
The System Journal: systemd-journald

As of 2015, systemd replaced SysV Init as a de facto system and service manager in most major Linux distributions. As a consequence, the journal daemon — journald — has become the standard logging component, superseding syslog in most aspects. The data is no longer stored in plain text but in binary form. Thus, the journalctl utility is necessary to read the logs. On top of that, journald is syslog compatible and can be integrated with syslog.

journalctl is the utility that is used to read and query systemd’s journal database. If invoked without options, it prints the entire journal:

# journalctl

-- Logs begin at Tue 2019-06-04 17:49:40 CEST, end at Tue 2019-06-04 18:13:10 CEST. --
jun 04 17:49:40 debian systemd-journald[339]: Runtime journal (/run/log/journal/) is 8.0M, max 159.6M, 151.6M free.
jun 04 17:49:40 debian kernel: microcode: microcode updated early to revision 0xcc, date = 2019-04-01
Jun 04 17:49:40 debian kernel: Linux version 4.9.0-8-amd64 (debian-kernel@lists.debian.org) (gcc version 6.3.0 20170516 (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) )
Jun 04 17:49:40 debian kernel: Command line: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-4.9.0-8-amd64 root=/dev/sda1 ro quiet
(...)

However, if invoked with the -k or --dmesg switches, it will be equivalent to using the dmesg command:

# journalctl -k

[ 0.000000] Linux version 4.9.0-9-amd64 (debian-kernel@lists.debian.org) (gcc version 6.3.0 20170516 (Debian 6.3.0-18+deb9u1) ) #1 SMP Debian 4.9.168-1+deb9u2 (2019-05-13)
[ 0.000000] Command line: BOOT_IMAGE=/boot/vmlinuz-4.9.0-9-amd64 root=UUID=5216e1e4-ae0e-441f-b8f5-8061c0034c74 ro quiet
(...)

Other interesting options for journalctl include:

-b, --boot

    It shows boot information.

-u

    It shows messages about a specified unit. Roughly, a unit can be defined as any resource handled by systemd. For example journalctl -u apache2.service is used to read messages about the apache2 web server.

-f

    It shows most recent journal messages and keeps printing new entries as they are appended to the journal — much like tail -f.

Guided Exercises

Explorational Exercises

    Reconsider the top output from the guided exercises and answer the following questions:

        What two steps would you follow to kill the apache web server?

        In the summary area, how could you display the information about physical memory and swap using progress bars?

        Now, sort the processes by memory usage:

        Now that you have memory information displayed in progress bars and processes sorted by memory usage, save these configurations so that you get them as default next time you use top:

        What file stores top’s configuration settings? Where does it live? How can you check for its existence?

    Learn about the command exec in Bash. Try to demonstrate its functionality by starting a Bash session, finding the Bash process with ps, then run exec /bin/sh and search for the process with the same PID again.

    Follow these steps to explore kernel events and udev’s dynamic management of devices:

        Hotplug a USB drive into your computer. Run dmesg and pay attention to the last lines. What is the most recent line?

        Bearing in mind the output from the previous command, run ls /dev/sd* and make sure your USB drive appears in the listing. What is the output?

        Now remove the USB drive and run dmesg again. How does the most recent line read?

        Run ls /dev/sd* again and make sure your device disappeared from the listing. What is the output?

Summary

In the context of data storage, the following topics have been discussed in this lesson: process management and system logging and messaging.

Regarding process management, we have learned the following:

    Programs generate processes and processes exist in a hierarchy.

    Every process has a unique identifier (PID) and a parent process identifier (PPID).

    top is a very useful command to dynamically and interactively explore the running processes of the system.

    ps can be used to obtain a snapshot of the current running processes in the system.

    The /proc directory includes directories for every running process in the system named after their PIDs.

    The concept of system load average — which is very useful to check on CPU utilization/overloading.

Concerning system logging, we must remember that:

    A log is a file where system events are recorded. Logs are invaluable when it comes to troubleshooting.

    Logging has traditionally been handled by special services such as syslog, syslog-ng or rsyslog. Nevertheless, some programs use their own logging daemons.

    Because logs are variable data, they are kept in /var and — sometimes — their names can give you a clue about their content (kern.log, auth.log, etc.)

    Most logs are written in plain text and can be read with any text editor as long as you have the right permissions. However, a few of them are binary and must be read using special commands.

    To avoid problems with disk space, log rotation is carried out by the logrotate utility.

    As for the kernel, it uses a circular data structure — the ring buffer — where boot messages are kept (old messages fade away over time).

    The system and service manager systemd replaced System V init in virtually all distros with journald becoming the standard logging service.

    To read systemd’s journal, the journalctl utility is needed.

Commands used in this lesson:

cat

    Concatenate/print file content.

dmesg

    Print the kernel ring buffer.

echo

    Display a line of text or a newline.

file

    Determine file type.

grep

    Print lines matching a pattern.

last

    Show a listing of last logged in users.

less

    Display contents of file one page at a time.

ls

    List directory contents.

journalctl

    Query the systemd journal.

tail

    Display the last lines of a file.

Answers to Explorational Exercises

    Reconsider the top output from the guided exercises and answer the following questions:

        What two steps would you follow to kill the apache web server?

        First, press k; then provide a kill value.

        In the summary area, how could you display the information about physical memory and swap using progress bars?

        By pressing m once or twice.

        Now, sort the processes by memory usage:

        M

        Now that you have memory information displayed in progress bars and processes sorted by memory usage, save these configurations so that you get them as default next time you use top:

        W

        What file stores top’s configuration settings? Where does it live? How can you check for its existence?

        The file is ~/.config/procps/toprc and lives in the user’s home directory (~). Since it is a hidden file (it resides in a directory whose name starts with a dot), we can check for its existence with ls -a (list all files). This file can be generated by pressing kbd:[Shift+W] while in top.

    Learn about the command exec in Bash. Try to demonstrate its functionality by starting a Bash session, finding the Bash process with ps, then run exec /bin/sh and search for the process with the same PID again.

    exec replaces a process with another command. In the following example we can see that the Bash process is replaced by /bin/sh (instead of /bin/sh becoming a child process):

    $ echo $$
    19877
    $ ps auxf | grep 19877 | head -1
    carol  19877  0.0  0.0   7448  3984 pts/25   Ss   21:17   0:00  \_ bash
    $ exec /bin/sh
    sh-5.0$ ps auxf | grep 19877 | head -1
    carol  19877  0.0  0.0   7448  3896 pts/25   Ss   21:17   0:00  \_ /bin/sh

    Follow these steps to explore kernel events and udev’s dynamic management of devices:

        Hotplug a USB drive into your computer. Run dmesg and pay attention to the last lines. What is the most recent line?

        You should get something along the lines of [ 1967.700468] sd 6:0:0:0: [sdb] Attached SCSI removable disk.

        Bearing in mind the output from the previous command, run ls /dev/sd* and make sure your USB drive appears in the listing. What is the output?

        Depending on the number of devices connected to your system, you should get something like /dev/sda /dev/sda1 /dev/sdb /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdb2. In our case, we find our USB drive (/dev/sdb) and its two partitions (/dev/sdb1 and /dev/sdb2).

        Now remove the USB drive and run dmesg again. How does the most recent line read?

        You should get something along the lines of [ 2458.881695] usb 1-9: USB disconnect, device number 6.

        Run ls /dev/sd* again and make sure your device disappeared from the listing. What is the output?

        In our case, /dev/sda /dev/sda1.

There are many different shells available in Linux, each with its own unique features and capabilities. Here is a brief overview of some of the most popular shells:

- **Bourne Shell (sh)**: The Bourne shell is the original Unix shell and is still widely used today. It is a simple and straightforward shell, but it lacks many of the features of more modern shells.
- **C Shell (csh)**: The C shell was designed to be more user-friendly than the Bourne shell. It features command history, tab completion, and other features that make it easier to use.
- **TENEX C Shell (tcsh)**: The TENEX C shell is an extension of the C shell that adds additional features such as job control and programmable aliases.
- **Korn Shell (ksh)**: The Korn shell is a compatible replacement for the Bourne shell. It features a number of enhancements, such as command history, tab completion, and job control.
- **Bourne Again Shell (bash)**: The Bourne Again shell is the most popular shell in Linux today. It is a powerful and versatile shell that features a wide range of features, including command history, tab completion, job control, scripting, and more.
- **Z Shell (zsh)**: The Z shell is an extended version of the Bourne Again shell. It features a number of enhancements, such as better command completion, programmable aliases, and spelling correction.
- **Friendly Interactive Shell (fish)**: The Friendly Interactive Shell is a modern, user-friendly shell that aims to provide an interactive and intuitive interface for users. It features a number of features, such as syntax highlighting, command suggestions, and auto-completion.

**Which shell should you use?**

The best shell for you will depend on your individual needs and preferences. If you are new to Linux, I recommend starting with the Bourne Again shell (bash). It is the most popular shell in Linux and is a good all-around choice. If you are looking for a more user-friendly shell, you may want to consider the Friendly Interactive Shell (fish). And if you are looking for a powerful and versatile shell, the Z shell (zsh) is a good option.

To change your default shell in Linux, you can edit the `/etc/passwd` file. Find your user account and change the shell value to the shell you want to use. For example, to change your default shell to the Bourne Again shell, you would change the shell value to `/bin/bash`.

Once you have changed your default shell, you can log out and log back in to start using your new shell.
